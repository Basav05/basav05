About Me

Hi, I’m Basavaraj  – a finance professional, DeFi builder, and blockchain enthusiast. With a deep passion for financial innovation, I specialize in bridging Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to create groundbreaking financial products. As a founding team member at Caddy Finance, I’m actively working on developing structured products, DeFi options, and Liquid Staked Derivatives (LSDs) to enhance capital efficiency and risk management.

My Journey

My career began in traditional finance, where I gained expertise in financial analysis, investment strategies, and risk assessment. However, my curiosity for blockchain technology led me to explore DeFi, recognizing its potential to revolutionize the financial landscape. A special thanks to Mr. Abhishek, whom I met on a solo trip to Bangkok. Our conversation about DeFi sparked my curiosity and encouraged me to dive deeper into this transformative space. Today, I am fortunate to be working alongside him at Caddy Finance, where we are building innovative financial products to drive the DeFi ecosystem forward.
